#  This project is a continual of previous two projects that emphasizes on pointers, arrays and strings. Hence listed below are lists of tasks:
1.  0. memset
 * The  memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the
       constant byte c.
 * Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
 * The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
 * Returns a pointer to the memory area s
2. memcpy
  * Write a function that copies memory area.
       - The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
       - Returns a pointer to dest
3. strchr
    * Write a function that locates a character in a string.
        * Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found
4. strpbrk
    * Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
        * The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept
        * Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found
5. str
    * Write a function that locates a substring.
        * The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared 
        * Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
6. Chess is mental torture
    * Write a function that prints the chessboard.
7. Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
    * The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire
8. Write a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
    * Double pointer, double fun
  
    
0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
