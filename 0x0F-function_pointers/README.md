# Function Pointer in C
## Description

**When working with pointers to functions, the C compiler needs to know not only that the pointer
variable points to a function, but also the type of value returned by that function
as well as the number and types of its arguments.**
### 0x0F-function_pointers
	0. Write a function that prints a name.
		- Prototype: void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *));

	1. Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

		- Prototype: void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int));
		- where size is the size of the array
		- and action is a pointer to the function you need to use
	2. Write a function that searches for an integer.
		
		- Prototype: int int_index(int *array, int size, int (*cmp)(int));
		- where size is the number of elements in the array array
		- cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values
		- int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0
		- If no element matches, return -1
		- If size <= 0, return -1
	3. Write a program that performs simple operations.
		
		- You are allowed to use the standard library
		- Usage: calc num1 operator num2
		- You can assume num1 and num2 are integers, so use the atoi function to convert them from the string input to int
		- operator is one of the following:
			* +: addition
			* -: subtraction
			* *: multiplication
			* /: division
			* %: modulo
		- The program prints the result of the operation, followed by a new line
		- You can assume that the result of all operations can be stored in an int
		- if the number of arguments is wrong, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 98
		- if the operator is none of the above, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 99
		- if the user tries to divide (/ or %) by 0, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 100
	4. 3-calc.h
	    * 3-op_functions.c
		- This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more):
			
			* op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b);
			* op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b);
			* op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b);
			* op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b);
			* op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);
            * 3-get_op_func.c
		- This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. You’re not allowed to declare any other function.

			* Prototype: int (*get_op_func(char *s))(int, int)
			* where s is the operator passed as argument to the program
			* This function returns a pointer to the function that corresponds to the operator given as a parameter. Example: get_op_func("+") should return a pointer to the function op_add
			* If s does not match any of the 5 expected operators (+, -, *, /, %), return NULL
	5. Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
	    * Usage: ./main number_of_bytes
	    * Output format:
		
		- the opcodes should be printed in hexadecimal, lowercase
		- each opcode is two char long
		- listing ends with a new line
	    * You are allowed to use printf and atoi
	    * You have to use atoi to convert the argument to an int
            * If the number of argument is not the correct one, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
	    * If the number of bytes is negative, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 2     
	    * You do not have to compile with any flags
